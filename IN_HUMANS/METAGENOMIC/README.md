⚠️ READ ME! ⚠️

For all scripts the following needs to be adapted:
           paths to files, modules version, SBATCH parameters

Steps for processing of sequencing data for: cleaning, read-based analysis and MAGs assembly.

           A. Pre-processing and cleaning: A_preprocessing
           
           B. Read-based analysis (MetaPhlAn4 and HUMAnN3): B_Read_based
           
           C. MAGs assembly: C_MAGs assembly

Strain-level profiling in metagenomic sequencing data:

           inStrain
           
           StrainPhlAn

Taxonmic annotation using mOTUs profiler, go to MOTUS folder
